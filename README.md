# custconsole.js
custconsole brought to webpages.


Welcome to first edition of custconsole.js.

CustConsole was first brought to Python to allow the creation of a customizable console for applications. Now, we bring it to the webpage in the form of JavaScript.

In the future, custconsole.js will be available on NPM to download for your Node.JS application (as it is intended way to be used). For now, the first version is available to test as a direct script file.

TO-DO LIST:
- [ ] Upload to NPM.
- [ ] Test NPM support.
- [ ] Generate documentation.
